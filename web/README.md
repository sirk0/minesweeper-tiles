# Minesweeper Tiles — TypeScript + Three.js app (`web/`)

The in-progress TypeScript rewrite (Three.js / WebGL), living alongside the
Python game per `docs/plans/typescript-rewrite-same-repo.md`.

**M6 — Polish.** Board animations (`src/render/animations.ts`), driven by a
single `CellAnimations` clock the renderer ticks each frame only while
something is in flight (the loop stays idle otherwise): a **reveal ripple**
(each freshly opened cell flashes brighter than its settled tone, staggered by
its distance from the click so a wave sweeps outward across a flood fill), a
**flag pop** (a placed flag's glyph springs in with a small ease-out-back
overshoot), and a **lose shake** (the whole board jitters and settles when a
mine detonates). Both meshes own their buffers, so the clock only reports what
to redraw (recolour these cells / rebuild glyphs / offset the board). Animations
honour `prefers-reduced-motion` out of the gate and can be toggled at runtime
through the `window.__ms.animations(false)` test seam; the Playwright suite runs
under emulated reduced-motion, so every visual baseline captures the settled
frame and gameplay assertions stay timing independent. iOS install polish:
`viewport-fit=cover` with safe-area insets on the header and menu,
`touch-action: none` + `-webkit-touch-callout: none` on the canvas, apple- and
standard `mobile-web-app-capable` metas, and the maskable/apple-touch icons the
PWA manifest already ships. A zero-dependency bundle gate (`npm run size`,
enforced in CI) keeps the shipped JS + CSS under the **250 KB gzip** budget
(currently ~145 KB). **All 105 modes, polished.**

**M5 — Aperiodic tilings.** Ports `src/boards/aperiodic.ts`: the Penrose P3
rhombi (exact ℤ[ζ5] vertex arithmetic, Robinson-triangle deflation) and the Hat
monotile (H/T/P/F metatile substitution in floating point, each vertex snapped
back to an exact Eisenstein integer id). Both grow generously and trim to the
centremost cells by Chebyshev distance for a roughly square patch. Their
difficulty presets move into the shared `data/presets.json` (so the conformance
oracle covers them), and the flat tiling picker gains an **Aperiodic** family
submenu (plane only). **All 105 modes.**

**M3 — Surface wraps (regular tilings).** Wraps the square / triangle /
hexagon tilings onto the four surfaces (`src/boards/surfaces.ts`): the closed
torus, the open two-sided cylinder, and the non-orientable Möbius strip and
Klein bottle — twelve new modes. Two-sided surfaces draw each cell as a flat
`DoubleSide` tile on the surface (no raised bevel, which would read as a recess
from the inside), so a cell looks and plays the same from either face; grout
under the tile gaps and depth-tested glyphs (occluded numbers hidden by nearer
geometry — also fixing bleed-through on the closed frames) complete the look.
The Klein bottle carries a `cellCycle` (a ring-translation graph
automorphism); the session scrolls it as a **view-layer permutation** — a
`remap` between geometric faces and the game cells painted on them — so cells
hidden behind the neck rotate into view (mouse wheel / two-finger scroll /
`[` `]` keys / the two header chevrons, back and forward) while the geometry
and game state stay put. The Flat-manifolds menu drills surface → tiling →
difficulty. 27 modes.

**M2 — 3D renderer + solids.** Ports the ten closed 3D boards (sphere,
snub dodecahedron, C80/C180 fullerenes, geodesic triangles, cube,
tetrahedron, cube frame, tetrahedron frame, stepped bipyramid) and adds the
3D half of the render pipeline: perspective camera, a custom trackball
(drag to rotate, arrow keys too), per-mode starting orientations, back-face
culling with an opaque base layer under the tile gaps, and a
`gl_FrontFacing` dimming shader ready for M3's two-sided surfaces. The
input state machine disambiguates tap / long-press / drag-rotate. 15 modes.

M0 (scaffold + pipeline proof: Vite, strict TS, PWA shell, CI/Pages) and M1
(core game rules, the five flat regular boards, HUD/menu from shared
config, deep links `?mode=&difficulty=&seed=`, the `window.__ms` test seam)
are the foundation this builds on. Boards are built from the **same**
`data/*.json` the Python game reads, and a conformance oracle
(`data/conformance.json`) asserts the two implementations produce identical
boards.

## Commands

```sh
cd web
npm install
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm run test        # vitest unit tests
npm run build       # tsc + vite build (production bundle + PWA)
npm run size        # gzip bundle audit — fails over the 250 KB budget
npm run e2e         # Playwright e2e + visual regression
npm run e2e:update  # refresh visual baselines
```

Cloud sessions: `@playwright/test` is **pinned** (not caret-ranged) to the
version whose bundled Chromium build matches the one preinstalled in the Claude
cloud image (`/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-<build>`), so `npm run e2e` resolves the
preinstalled browser and runs directly — no download, no env var. Keep the pin
in step with the image when bumping Playwright: a caret range silently floats to
a newer build than the image ships, and e2e then fails with "Executable doesn't
exist". As a fallback for a mismatched image, point Playwright at whatever build
is present with
`PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE=/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-<build>/chrome-linux/chrome npm run e2e`
(the config honours it). CI installs the pinned build itself, so it is
self-consistent regardless of the image.

## Agent notes: driving the app headless

Practical knowledge for verifying changes by actually running the app
(screenshots are the primary review artifact in this repo):

- **Ad-hoc screenshots**: `npm run build`, `npx vite preview --port 4173`
  in the background, then a small Playwright script against
  `http://localhost:4173/?mode=X&difficulty=Y&seed=N`. Launch Chromium with
  `executablePath` set to the preinstalled browser and the SwiftShader args
  from `playwright.config.ts` so output matches CI. Wait for
  `body[data-ready]` before shooting. **Put the script inside `web/`** —
  Node resolves `@playwright/test` from the script's location, not the cwd.
- **The `window.__ms` seam** is the way in: `cells()`, `startBoard(mode,
  difficulty, {mines|seed})`, `reveal/flag/chord(cell)`, `rotate(dx, dy)`
  (drag-pixels), `state()`. On 3D boards `cellScreenXY(cell)` returns
  `null` for cells facing away — filter for a visible cell instead of
  indexing blindly.
- **Flood-fill eats sparse fixtures**: on a closed surface a reveal floods
  around the whole solid past a thin mine wall, instantly winning the game
  (auto-flagging every mine). To stage a mixed hidden/revealed screenshot,
  reveal only cells adjacent to mines (each shows a number, so nothing
  cascades), or use a mine-dense fixture.
- **`--update-snapshots` does not touch a baseline that passes within
  `maxDiffPixelRatio` tolerance** (5% here). After an intentional small
  visual change (e.g. header tweaks), delete the affected
  `tests/e2e/gallery.spec.ts-snapshots/*.png` and regenerate, or the
  committed baselines silently keep the old pixels. Baselines are only
  authoritative under the pinned software-WebGL environment (CI, or a
  cloud session with the same launch args); regenerate them there, then
  re-run the spec to confirm determinism.
- **Playwright's `webServer` reuses a running port-4173 server** outside
  CI. `vite preview` serves `dist/` from disk, so an `npm run build` is
  enough to refresh it — but stale servers are a classic source of
  "my change has no effect".
- **Animations are off in the e2e suite** (`contextOptions.reducedMotion:
  "reduce"` in `playwright.config.ts`), so screenshots catch the settled
  frame. To eyeball an animation in an ad-hoc capture, launch Chromium
  *without* reduced-motion, call `window.__ms.animations(true)`, drive a
  move, then screenshot on a short `waitForTimeout` mid-flight — the reveal
  ripple/flag pop/lose shake all settle back to the static baseline within
  ~0.5 s.
- The Python game is the behavior reference; run it headless per the
  "Screenshots" section in the repo-root CLAUDE.md when unsure how
  something is supposed to look or feel.

## Layout

- `src/game.ts`, `src/rng.ts` — pure game rules (port of `game.py`) and a
  seedable RNG.
- `src/boards/` — `core.ts` (Board/Board3D, adjacency, topology, vector
  helpers), `tilings.ts` (the flat regular builders), `solids.ts` (the
  closed 3D boards), `surfaces.ts` (the torus/cylinder/Möbius/Klein wraps and
  the Klein `cellCycle`), `catalog.ts` / `presets.ts` (read `data/*.json`).
- `src/render/` — one Three.js pipeline: `renderer.ts` (scene, ortho +
  perspective cameras, trackball rotation, resize, picking),
  `boardMesh.ts` (shared cell-visual vocabulary), `polygonBoard.ts` /
  `solidBoard.ts` (merged beveled cell geometry — flat plane vs. solid
  surface — per-cell colours, hover, glyph quads), `glyphAtlas.ts`
  (canvas-baked digit/flag/mine texture), `animations.ts` (the shared
  reveal-ripple / flag-pop / lose-shake clock).
- `src/session.ts` — `GameSession`: Game ↔ mesh ↔ HUD.
- `src/input/controls.ts` — pointer/touch state machine (tap, long-press,
  right-click, drag-rotate on 3D boards).
- `src/ui/` — HTML/CSS overlay chrome: `hud.ts` (header) and `menu.ts` (home),
  both **rendered from the shared UI-screen config**.
- `src/config/screens.ts` — typed accessor over `../data/ui/screens.json`.
- `src/testHook.ts` — the `window.__ms` seam Playwright drives.

## Shared configuration

UI-screen chrome (header slots, menu structure, difficulty rows, theme, smiley
faces) is declared once in **`data/ui/screens.json`** at the repo root and read
by both front-ends, so the pygame and TypeScript UIs can be kept in sync from a
single source rather than hand-matched. `src/config/screens.ts` gives the TS app
compile-time types over it. Later milestones extend the same shared-`data/`
approach to the board catalog and presets (see the plan).

## Deploy

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `web` job) typechecks, unit-tests, builds and
runs the e2e/visual suite. During the transition GitHub Pages hosts both apps:
the pygbag build at the site root, this app under `/next/` (Vite `base` set from
`VITE_BASE` in `deploy-pages.yml`). Visual baselines are only authoritative in
the pinned CI environment (software WebGL / SwiftShader).
